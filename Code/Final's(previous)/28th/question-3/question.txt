Consider that you are given two matrices A and B. You need to find
the matrix C, such that C is the multiplicative result of A and B.
Thus, C=AxB.

(a) Write a java program to find C. Note that you need to write the
    program to take input as well as to calculate and print the final result.
    
(b) To make the computation faster, the thread-based program can be a help. 
    Write a java program to find C using two threads.
    
(c) Explain the concept of Event Triggering with an example related to Java 
    Graphical User Interface(GUI). Analyze the importance and explain how it 
    brings additional improvement to an application.
