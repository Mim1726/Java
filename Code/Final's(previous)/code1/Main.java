/* Write a program in Java to perform the following:
Consider the parent class named Account. Design its two child classes named CurrentAccount and SavingsAccount.
Child classes should have at least one additional meaningful variable declared within them, one parameterized
constructor, and a toString method. The CurrentAccount maintains daily transactions, and provides a chequebook
facility, but does not provide any interest. The SavingsAccount does not provide any chequebook but provides 
yearly interest.
